## 🌍 What is AWS?  

Amazon Web Services (**AWS**) is a **cloud computing platform** provided by **Amazon**. It offers a variety of **services** that allow individuals and businesses to build, deploy, and manage applications without needing to own physical hardware.

## ☁️ What is Cloud Computing?  

Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources** over the internet. Instead of buying and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can **rent computing power, storage, and databases** from AWS and access them from anywhere.

### 🔹 Types of Cloud Computing
1. **Public Cloud** – Services are provided over the internet and shared among multiple users (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
2. **Private Cloud** – A cloud environment dedicated to a single organization.
3. **Hybrid Cloud** – A combination of both **public** and **private** clouds.

### 🌎 **Key Infrastructure Components:**
- **Regions** 🌍 – Different physical locations worldwide (e.g., US-East-1, Asia-Pacific).
- **Availability Zones (AZs)** 🏢 – Multiple data centers within a region for fault tolerance.
- **Edge Locations** 🌐 – AWS locations closer to users to improve performance (used in services like CloudFront).
