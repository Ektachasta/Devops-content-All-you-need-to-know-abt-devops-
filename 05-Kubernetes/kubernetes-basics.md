# 🚀 Kubernetes Beginner-Friendly Guide  

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source **container orchestration** tool that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

---
## 📌 Basic Concepts  

### 🟢 **Pod**  
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes that encapsulates one or more containers.  

### 🔵 **Service**  
A Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy to access them, ensuring stable networking.  

### 🟠 **Namespace**  
A Namespace is a way to logically divide a Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters for resource isolation.  

### 🔴 **Node**  
A Node is a physical or virtual machine that runs containerized applications. A Kubernetes cluster consists of multiple nodes.

## 📌 Why Use Kubernetes?  

✅ **Automated Scaling** – Scale apps up or down based on demand.  
✅ **Self-Healing** – Restart failed containers automatically.  
✅ **Load Balancing** – Distributes traffic to ensure stability.  
✅ **Rolling Updates** – Update applications without downtime.  
✅ **Service Discovery** – Apps find each other without hardcoded IPs.

## 🛠️ Kubernetes Architecture  

### 📍 Master Node (Control Plane)  
- **API Server** – Communicates with users & worker nodes.  
- **Scheduler** – Assigns workloads to worker nodes.  
- **Controller Manager** – Ensures desired state of clusters.  
- **etcd** – Stores cluster configuration (key-value store).  

### 📍 Worker Nodes  
- **Kubelet** – Ensures containers are running properly.  
- **Container Runtime** – Runs containers (Docker, containerd, etc.).  
- **Kube Proxy** – Handles networking and load balancing.

## 📦 Kubernetes Core Components  

| Component  | Description |
|------------|------------|
| **Pod** 🟢 | Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes (contains one or more containers). |
| **Service** 🌐 | Exposes a set of pods via a stable IP. |
| **Deployment** 🔄 | Manages application updates (rolling updates, rollback). |
| **Namespace** 🏷️ | Isolates resources within a cluster. |
| **ConfigMap & Secret** 🔑 | Stores configuration data securely. |
| **Ingress** 🚦 | Manages external HTTP/S access to services. |

## 🏗️ Understanding Deployments in Kubernetes  

A **Deployment** in Kubernetes is used to **manage, update, and scale applications** automatically. It defines the **desired state** of an application and ensures that it is maintained across the cluster.

### 🔹 How Deployments Work?  
- You specify the **container image**, the **number of replicas**, and the **configuration** in a YAML file.  
- Kubernetes ensures that the **specified number of pods** are always running.  
- If a pod fails, Kubernetes automatically replaces it.  
- Deployments support **rolling updates**, allowing you to update applications **without downtime**.  
- In case of failure, Kubernetes can **rollback** to a previous version.

### 🔹 Key Features of Deployments:  
✔ **Ensures high availability** by running multiple instances of an app.  
✔ **Rolling updates** without downtime.  
✔ **Automatic rollback** if something goes wrong.  
✔ **Self-healing** – If a pod crashes, Kubernetes restarts it.

## 📖 Essential Commands  

**List all running pods**
```sh
kubectl get pods
```
**Get details of a specific pod**
```sh
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
**View logs of a running pod**
```sh
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
**Delete a specific pod**
```sh
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```
**List all services**
```sh
kubectl get services
```
**Delete a service**
```sh
kubectl delete service <service-name>
```
